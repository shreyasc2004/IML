#Brain Tumor Detection using CNN: 

1. Importing Essential Libraries: 
Initiate the implementation by importing the required libraries that allow data manipulation, visualization alongside model construction capabilities from TensorFlow.

2. A procedure must be established to define the paths and directories which contain the dataset. 
The program sets dataset paths and training/test directory paths and brain tumor type categories.

3. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset: 
The program reads training images per category from directories before creating a data management setup with visualization functions for tumor type distributions.

4. The application shows each tumor type through image visualization. 
The application should present multiple test photographs from each tumor class in an array of sub-graphs.

5. Users can determine Image Size together with Batch Size and Epochs in the training process. 
The project needs definitions of image dimensions as well as batch size parameters and training epoch quantity.

6. Data Augmentation and Preprocessing: 
The training data requires augmentation to enhance model generalization through different transformation methods like rotation, shifting and zooming.

7. Building the Model Architecture: 
Create a convolutional neural network using convolution layers together with max pooling and dense layers while implementing dropout layer operations. The model needs to be compiled with Adam optimizer together with categorical cross-entropy loss.

8. Training and Validation: 
The training process proceeds through the training generator alongside accuracy and loss measurements until completion of each epoch. Rephrase Validation step by performing it on the test generator.

9. Visualization Through Graphs: 
Keep track of model learning progress through visual inspection of accuracy/loss graphs that present changes over time across epochs.

10. Evaluation: 
Test the model for performance evaluation by determining its test loss numbers and accuracy levels.

11. Confusion Matrix and Explanation: 
An interpretation of classification results per class appears in the form of a confusion matrix. The system should present categorized images showing actual and forecasted labels next to each other.

12. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score Calculation: 
Obtain precision, recall and F1-score values from the confusion matrix for each class.

13. Saving the Trained Model: 
The trained model can be saved to a file to maintain its availability for future uses or deployment.
