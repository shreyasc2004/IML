Brain Tumor Detection using CNN: 

1. Importing Essential Libraries: 
Start by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model construction with TensorFlow.

2. Setting Up Dataset Paths and Directories: 
Define the dataset path and training/testing directories, and establish the categories for brain tumor types.

3. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset: 
Read images from each category in the training directory, create a DataFrame to store image data, and visualize the distribution of tumor types.

4. Visualizing Images for Each Tumor Type: 
Display sample images for each tumor type in a grid of subplots.

5. Setting Image Size, Batch Size, and Epochs: 
Define image dimensions, batch size for training, and the number of training epochs.

6. Data Augmentation and Preprocessing: 
Augment the training dataset to improve model generalization using techniques like rotation, shifting, zooming, etc.

7. Building the Model Architecture: 
Construct a CNN model with convolutional, max pooling, dense, and dropout layers. Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

8. Training and Validation: 
Train the model using the training generator, tracking accuracy and loss over epochs. Validate on the test generator as well.

9. Visualization Through Graphs: 
Plot training and validation accuracy/loss curves over epochs to monitor the model's learning progress.

10. Evaluation: 
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, calculating test loss and accuracy.

11. Confusion Matrix and Explanation: 
Visualize a confusion matrix to analyze the model's classification performance for each class. Display sample images along with their predicted and true labels.

12. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score Calculation: 
Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class from the confusion matrix.

13. Saving the Trained Model: 
Save the trained model to a file for future use or deployment.
